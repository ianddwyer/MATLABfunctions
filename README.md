Ever have the issue of needing to find scaling for plot or print 
and want to make a program more dynamic to save time on printouts in MATLAB? 
No worries, unit scaling is obtained and its prefix is output with a rescaling factor to use for use of the number!
This can be used for general dataset scaling as well to reduce floating point computations!
